#### About

This project tries to provide a secure, stable and decentralized messaging platform.

All messages are routed through a server that anyone can host, and messages are stored in IPFS, so the data is decentralized.

This is in experimental phase.

#### TODO
- [] Provive some kind of end-to-end encryption
- [] Make some useful client as example
